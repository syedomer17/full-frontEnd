Think of display like the type of box a sticker comes in. Some stickers are in a block, some in a line, and some are hidden.

🎨 Common display values:
block - Starts on a new line and takes up the full width.
📌 Like a big box that always pushes the next sticker to the next line.

inline - Stays in the same line and only takes up as much space as needed.
📌 Like small stickers that fit next to each other.

none - Completely disappears!
📌 Like a hidden sticker that you can’t see.

📍 2. Position Property
Now, let’s learn how to place stickers on your paper using the position property.

🏠 Types of Positioning
1️⃣ Static (Default)
🎈 This is like placing a sticker normally on paper. It does not move.


2️⃣ Relative
🎈 This is like a floating sticker that you can move a little from its normal place.
📌 Example: A balloon floating slightly from its original position.

3️⃣ Absolute
🎈 This sticker ignores all the other stickers and sticks wherever you tell it to.

📌 Example: A butterfly anywhere on the paper, ignoring other stickers.

4️⃣ Fixed
🎈 This sticker stays in the same place even if you scroll the paper.

📌 Example: A clock sticking on the wall, even if you move the paper.

5️⃣ Sticky
🎈 This sticker moves when you scroll but stops at a certain point.
