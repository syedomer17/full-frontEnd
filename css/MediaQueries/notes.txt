📱 Media Queries (Responsive Design)
1️⃣ What are Media Queries?
Imagine you're making a magical T-shirt that changes size depending on who's wearing it! 👕

If a kid wears it, it shrinks!

If a giant wears it, it expands!

👉 Media Queries do the same for websites! They change the layout depending on the screen size.

2️⃣ How Do They Work?
📌 A media query checks the screen size and applies styles only when the condition is true.

Example:
/* Default style for all screens */
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* When the screen is 600px or smaller (like a phone) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: pink;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
}
✅ Now, if the screen is smaller than 600px, the background turns pink! 🎉

3️⃣ Common Media Query Breakpoints
📌 Different devices have different screen sizes. We use breakpoints to handle them.

Device Type	Width Breakpoint
📱 Mobile	max-width: 600px
📺 Tablet	max-width: 900px
💻 Laptop	max-width: 1200px
🖥️ Desktop	 No limit (default)
