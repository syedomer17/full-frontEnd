🎮 Best Practices for Flexbox
✅ Use for simple things like:

Navbars

Cards

Toolbars

Aligning buttons

✅ Use justify-content for spacing side to side

✅ Use align-items to stack things up and down

❌ Don't try to build big pages with only Flexbox — it gets messy!

🏗️ Best Practices for Grid
✅ Use for entire page layouts like:

Website skeletons

Dashboards

Landing pages

Image galleries

✅ Use grid-template-areas to keep it readable

✅ Use fr, auto, %, px to size rows/columns

✅ Combine Grid + Flexbox: Use Grid to structure, then Flexbox inside each area to arrange content
