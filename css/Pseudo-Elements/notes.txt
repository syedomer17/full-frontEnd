🧒 What are Pseudo-Elements?
Imagine you have a book 📖. Even if you didn't write anything at the beginning or end, the book can still show some auto-text like “Chapter 1” or “The End” — that’s like pseudo-elements!

We use them in CSS to:

Add stuff before or after elements (::before, ::after)

Style parts of elements (like ::first-line, ::first-letter)

✏️ Example in Plain Words:

p::before {
  content: "📌 Start: ";
}
p::after {
  content: " ✅ End.";
}
Now any <p> will start with "📌 Start:" and end with "✅ End."

🪄 What You Learned:
Selector	    Magic it does
::before	    Adds content before an element
::after	        Adds content after an element
::first-letter	Styles the first letter of a block
::first-line	Styles the first line of text
attr()	        Pulls the value of an attribute (like tooltips!)
