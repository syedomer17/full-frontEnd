🌟 What is Flexbox?
Imagine you have a magical shelf 🛒 where you can easily arrange toys in a straight line (row) or stack them up (column). Flexbox helps you organize things inside a container efficiently.

How to Enable Flexbox?
To activate Flexbox, you set display: flex; on a container.
Now, the things inside (children) will follow the Flexbox rules!

📌 1. Alignment (align-items)
How should toys stand on the shelf?

Value	      Effect
flex-start	  All toys stand at the top
flex-end	  All toys stand at the bottom
center	      All toys stand in the middle
stretch	      Toys stretch to fill space
baseline	  Toys align based on text inside them

ex:
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center; /* All items align at the center */
}
🔹 Visual Example:
Imagine 5 teddy bears standing in a row 🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸

align-items: flex-start; → All bears on top

align-items: center; → All bears in the middle

align-items: flex-end; → All bears on the bottom

📌 2. Wrapping (flex-wrap)
Should all toys fit in one row, or can they break into multiple rows?

Value	Effect
nowrap	Everything stays in one row (default)
wrap	Items move to the next line if needed
wrap-reverse	Items move to the previous line

ex:
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Items move to a new row if needed */
}
🔹 Visual Example:
Imagine 10 cars 🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️

flex-wrap: nowrap; → 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗 (All in one row, even if space runs out)

flex-wrap: wrap; → 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗
      🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗 (Moves to a new row)

📌 3. Justification (justify-content)
How should the toys be spaced across the shelf?

Value	Effect
flex-start	All toys start from the left
flex-end	All toys start from the right
center	Toys stay in the center
space-between	First & last toy on edges, others evenly spaced
space-around	Equal space around every toy
space-evenly	Equal space between & around every toy

Example:
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Items are evenly distributed */
}

🔹 Visual Example:
Imagine 5 footballs ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽

justify-content: flex-start; → ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽ (All on the left)

justify-content: center; →   ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽   (Centered)

justify-content: space-between; → ⚽   ⚽   ⚽   ⚽   ⚽ (Spread out)

justify-content: space-evenly; →   ⚽   ⚽   ⚽   ⚽   ⚽   (More space)
