🍼 What is Responsive Design?
Responsive design means your website looks good on all devices: small phones, tablets, laptops, and big TVs!

📱 Mobile-First Approach:
This means we design for small screens first, then add rules to make it look better on bigger screens.

Think of it like wearing a small shirt and changing into bigger clothes if you grow! 😄

/* Mobile styles first */
.container {
  background-color: lightyellow;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Then add styles for bigger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    background-color: lightblue;
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

🖥️ Desktop-First Approach:
Here, we design for big screens first, and then shrink things down for smaller ones.

Like starting with adult clothes, and then switching to kid sizes when needed! 😂
/* Desktop styles first */
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 18px;
}

/* Then override for smaller screens */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    background-color: lightyellow;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
👑 Which One is Better?
Mobile-First is most popular today because most people browse on phones!

It makes websites faster and more user-friendly on small devices.
