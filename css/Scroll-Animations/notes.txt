🧒 Easy Explanation:
1. Parallax – “Magic background moves slower than the stuff in front!”
Feels like a cartoon where the background moves slowly and the characters move faster.

2. Scroll Snapping – “It’s like magnetic pages!”
When you scroll, the page “snaps” to the next section instead of stopping anywhere.

3. Sticky Elements – “This thing follows you as you scroll!”
Like a sticky note that stays at the top while the rest scrolls.

🧪 What You’ll See:
Parallax: Big background image moves slower than your scroll.

Scroll Snap: Scrolls like flipping pages.

Sticky Header: Sticks on top while rest scrolls.
