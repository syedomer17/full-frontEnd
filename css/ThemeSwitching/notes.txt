Imagine your webpage is like a room. You can press a button and switch the lights on or off!

Light Mode = Lights ON ðŸ’¡ (White background, dark text)

Dark Mode = Lights OFF ðŸŒ™ (Dark background, white text)

We do this by changing the CSS theme using a button!


ðŸ’¡ How it Works:
We use :root to define CSS variables.

.dark-theme changes those variables to dark ones.

The JavaScript function toggleTheme() just adds or removes the dark-theme class.

ðŸŒˆ Try This:
Customize the button style per theme.

Store the user's theme in localStorage so it remembers the theme even if you reload.
