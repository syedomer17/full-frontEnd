CSS Grid Explained (For a 10-Year-Old)
Imagine a chessboard üèÅ. Each square is a cell where you can place something. CSS Grid works the same way! You create rows and columns, and you decide where each item goes.

Key Concepts of CSS Grid
Grid Container (display: grid)

This turns an element into a grid system.

It holds all the grid items inside it.

Rows & Columns (grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns)

You decide how many rows and columns your grid should have.

Example:
grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px;

This creates 3 columns with different widths.

Gaps (gap)

This adds space between rows and columns.

Example:
gap: 10px;

This means each row and column will have a 10px gap.

Grid Areas (grid-area)

You can name different parts of your grid and place items in specific locations.

Example:
grid-area: header;

This places an item in the "header" section.
